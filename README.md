Structure of the Repository

    Code: This directory will contain the code files related to exercises, examples, and projects as I progress through my learning journey.

    Notes: I will maintain documentation and notes on Rust best practices, concepts, and any challenges faced during the learning process.

Progress Tracking

I'll use GitHub Issues and Projects to track my progress, document any questions, and manage the overall learning plan.
